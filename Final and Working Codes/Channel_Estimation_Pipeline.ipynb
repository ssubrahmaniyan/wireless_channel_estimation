    "This notebook contains the complete pipeline necessary to test and observe concepts covered upto 15/12/2024\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves:\n",
    "1. Jakes' Sum of Sinusoids 1D complex channel generation with Rayleigh's Multipath Fading\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random bit generation (-1 or 1), transmission and reception with noise of specified SNR and channel gain of specified autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BPSK demodulation of received signals using estimated channel gains\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pipeline to assign some packets transmitted as headers and periodically transmit these headers, estimate channels of these headers using least squares, and demodulate all data within one coherence time from the header, so that the channel can be assumed constant in the data \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pipeline to predict channel gains using a Vector AutoRegressive model that is trained on least-squares estimated channels that are developed by transmitting pilots first. When our predicted channels differ from a least-squares estimate of the channel for a packet in the future, then it means our prediction is wrong, and hence we retransmit pilots and retrain our VAR model on a fresh and accurate set of least-square estimated channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Plotting the following:\n",
    "    * Retransmission frequency (number of pilot bits transmitted/number of total bits transmitted) Vs Doppler Frequency for the VAR approach\n",
    "    * Retransmission frequency Vs Doppler frequency for different MSE thresholds ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 for the VAR approach\n",
    "    * BER vs SNR plot for the packet-and-header based approach (resulting in what is called a Waterfall plot) and the autoregression-based approach. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The user must specify the Doppler frequency Fd, number of samples N, SNR value, MSE threshold and the Sampling Frequency Fs wherever required to observe corresponding outputs. "
