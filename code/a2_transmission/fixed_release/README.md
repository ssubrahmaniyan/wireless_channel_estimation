# Fixes for release on 22 August 2024

## Fixes done on 14 August 2024
1. Generalized the channel generation code using sum of sines method to work with complex numbers and made it professional by adding command line arguments
2. Fixed plotting file to work in a general manner without having to modify much of the code.'

## Fixes done of 15 August 2024
1. Rewrote transmission simulation to be compatible with the new type of channel generations.
2. Created a plot of BER, MSE as a function of SNR for a fixed doppler frequency of 100 Hz.
