This directory is organized as follows:
* Codes - this folder contains all codes and implementations created during the course of the project, most of which did not fully meet some requirements. Valuable information from these implementations has been integrated in codes present in the Final and Working Codes folder
  
* References - Textual material used during the course of the project
  
* Final and Working Codes - Documented and fixed implementations that integrate several concepts and codes. These codes summarize the results of different tasks in the project.
  
* Outputs, Plots and Inferences - Contains useful plots and inferences derived from working on the project, along with some plots and inferences which are seemingly incorrect or unexpected (organized in a separate subfolder).
  
* Release - The final results of implementations and discussions
